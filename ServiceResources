# ServiceManager for SetupHelper
# contains a functions to install, remove, start and stop a package's service

# managing a normal package's service is straight forward
#
# normally, services are connected via a symbolic link, but to avoid issues with
# updating package files, the service directory is COPIED to the /service directory instead.
#
# If the active copy of the service already exists, the run and log/run files are updated
# ONLY if there are changes. This leaves other files managed by supervise untouched.
#
# For all functions, $1 specifies the package name
#
# functions that begin with _ skip checks and do not log activity


# _killServiceProcesses makes sure there are no service processes running
# The intent is to force supervise to run the new version 
# must be called from other functions that have already made the necessary checks

# startService and stopService start and stop the service, respectively
# the 'down' flag is also cleared/set to control service runs in the future
# startService will cause the service to stop then start again !!!
